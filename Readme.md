## Final project of CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
# Rockermind

Rockermind is a website where if you are a Fan, you can meet new bands, their music and the places where they play. You can follow them to see their posts and react to them, see their upcoming concerts and listen to some of their music. If you are a Rocker, you can make post, see your popularity statistics and accept concerts. On the other hand, if you are a Place Owner, you can create new events and hire bands to play in them.

# Why do I think Rockermind is enough to pass the course?

In order to achieve a project that is sufficiently different from the others, specifically the social network project, I have to say that complexity and approach of Rockermind is not in posts management. Instead, it is in the managements of roles by user (the interaction and relationships between their and their attributes), this involves a large and related Django model between its classes, it also involves a new type of user that inherits from DjangoUser and from which the other roles depend.

Another important aspect was the research in external sources different from the course notes, like the capture, storage, transmission and visualization of the images. The sending of POST request using FETCH function in JavaScript and solving the csrftoken trouble. Also, there is a treatment of the URL of the song, to allow the user to copy and paste the Youtube link from the navigation bar and a use of PopUp menus in order to provide a more agile interaction with the WebSite.

Finally I think that the site is aesthetically pleasing, and this was hard. Also, there is interesting uses of JavaScript like the dynamic sign up form and the progressive and random display of bands for Place Owners (this involves a communication between front-end and back-end to avoid sending bands that were already shown, but keeping the randomness of them).

Besides, I have to say that when I did the penultimate project, it was before July, so I did the Pizza project. It is not excuse to do a Social Network in itself, but I want to emphasize that the only similarity between these two projects is the posts and the reacts. However, I tried to innovate these conflicting aspects, with the use of images in posts and the distinction of reactions between likes and loves. So, the events creation, notifications, user attributes and the theme of the WebSite in general is completely original.

In summary, the complexity of Rockermind is in the information of roles by user, the interaction between them (including images and dependencies between their actions), in addition to the aesthetic aspects which provide a pleasant interaction with the WebSite.

  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

# New Features!

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
